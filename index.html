            Of the FBI. Maybe we should talk about Meredith first. Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March. 
            There's a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture.

            I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. 
            I guess we are back to normal. They came up with that idea really fast. Oh, uh, no. 
            No, no, no, no. I'm, uh, I'm actually with a tour group myself, so- [laughter] Hello! I'm Abraham Lincoln! 
            Some people call me the great emancipator, but, uh, you might know me from the penny. [laughter]
            
            Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, 
            I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? 
            Pam and I don't have to agree on everything. Are you sure? 
            No, a new copier! [only Oscar applauds] Unless everybody can agree on something better? </p>
